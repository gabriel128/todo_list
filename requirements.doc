Could you write me a todo list management web application where:
 - I can have my todo list displayed. ---- Done
 - I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries).  ----- Done
 - Assign priorities and due dates to the entries. ---- Done
 - I can sort my entry lists using due date and priority. ---- Done
 - I can mark an entry as completed. ---- Done
 - Minimal UI/UX design is needed. -- Done
 - I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
 not an option. ---- Done
 - Write a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger actions on your app (same actions available on the webpage).
 - You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
 - As complementary to the last item, one should be able to create users in the system via an interface,
   probably a signup/register screen.
